        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p class="intro">
          Hi, I'm Matt!  I’m currently a member of the SGA Student Life Committee, where our team is working on the
          Student Organization Accessibility Project (add another page for this during Project #3).
          At my previous college, I held numerous positions including Service Chair, Fellowship
          Chair, and Vice President at an award-winning chapter of Phi Theta.  I’ve served as a
          leader inside the classroom as a Supplemental Instructor.
          <br/> <br/>
          My teamwork and leadership experience extends into the professional world too. I took a
          break from college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants. There, I
          gained professional experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event
          planning, balancing P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a
          multimillion dollar department at a first-class hospitality firm.  I have a unique
          combination of leadership and team experience in both academic and professional settings.

        <h4>Why should you vote for Me?</h4>
        <p>
          Although there are many issues I'd like to see addressed, here are few topics that my
          constituents have brought to my attention:
          <section>

            </figure>
            <h5>Social Responsibility</h5>
            Student orgs should be equally accessible to ALL students, even those who come from
            low-income families, are the first in their family to attend college, or come from other
            underserved communities.
            <br/> <br/>
            Start a bonus points "drive" (like a food drive... but instead of collecting canned
            goods we'll collect bonus points and/or non-perishables purchased with bonus points)
            <br/>(For Project 3, add a second page about Unused Declining Dollars.)

            </figure>
            <h5>Leadership</h5>
            It's no secret that SGA has had its fair share of setbacks.  I'd like to start by
            addressing the shortcomings within our Bylaws and Constitution.  I recently proposed the
            Governmental Affairs Committee to address these aissues quickly and thoroughly.

            <h5>Integrity</h5>
            Greater transparency between the Executive Board, the Senate, and the student body.
            <br/> <br/>
            SGA Voting Records.  Senators are responsible for representing the interests of their
            college, and the student body must be able to hold senators accountable! I would like
            to implement a voting record (via iClickers) so that our senators votes can be
            recorded and made available to the students. At any time, the student body could
            review a senators voting record to ensure that their interests are being represented
            by their senators and hold SGA accountable.
