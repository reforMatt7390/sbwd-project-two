        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p class="p-intro-1">
          Hi, I'm Matt!  I’m currently a member of the SGA Student Life Committee, where our team is working on the
          Student Organization Accessibility Project (add another page for this during Project #3).
          At my previous college, I held numerous positions including Service Chair, Fellowship
          Chair, and Vice President at an award-winning chapter of Phi Theta.  I’ve served as a
          leader inside the classroom as a Supplemental Instructor.
        </p>
        <p class="p-intro-2">
          My teamwork and leadership experience extends into the professional world too. I took a
          break from college and spent a few years managing large hotels and restaurants. There, I
          gained professional experience leading small and large teams, throwing lit parties/event
          planning, balancing P&L/financial statements, and managing the overall execution of a
          multimillion dollar department at a first-class hospitality firm.  I have a unique
          combination of leadership and team experience in both academic and professional settings.

          Although there are many issues I'd like to see addressed, here are few topics that my
          constituents have brought to my attention:

          </figure>
          <h5>Social Responsibility</h5>
          <p class="p-social-responsibility-1">
            Student orgs should be equally accessible to ALL students, even those who come from
            low-income families, are the first in their family to attend college, or come from
            other underserved communities.
          </p>
          <p class="p-social-responsibility-2">
            Start a bonus points "drive" (like a food drive... but instead of collecting canned
            goods we'll collect bonus points and/or non-perishables purchased with bonus points)
            <br/>(For Project 3, add a second page about Unused Declining Dollars.)

          <h5>Leadership</h5>
          <p class="p-leadership-1">
            It's no secret that SGA has had its fair share of setbacks.  I'd like to start by
            addressing the shortcomings within our Bylaws and Constitution.  I recently proposed the
            Governmental Affairs Committee to address these aissues quickly and thoroughly.
          </p>
          <p class="p-leadership-1">
            (second item here???)
          </p>

            <img src="images/shield.png" alt="Shield.">
          </figure>
          <h5>Integrity</h5>
          <p class="p-integrity-1">
            Transparency.  Students have voiced many concerns about the lack of transparency between
            SGA and student body.  I hope to address this issue by inviting students without SGA
            affiliation to participate in committees, and releasing any/all information (not deemed
            confidential) to the student body, encouraging more open dialogues.  Although the Exec
            Board meets in private, I also encourage them to post minutes on any non-confidential
            matters.
          </p>
          <p class="p-leadership-2">
            SGA Voting Records.  Senators are responsible for representing the interests of their
            college, and the student body must be able to hold senators accountable! I would like
            to implement a voting record (via iClickers) so that our senators votes can be
            recorded and made available to the students. At any time, the student body could
            review a senators voting record to ensure that their interests are being represented
            by their senators and hold SGA accountable.
